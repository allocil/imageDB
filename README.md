# imageDB
Drupal 7 module for storing images in DB

This module should be useless to many developers, but in certain scenarios where you are not allowed to write in disk it can save you a lot of time.

You can access an  image using an URL like:

http://[site-path]/dbimage/image/[node-nid]/[field-name]/[index-of-image]/[beautiful-image-name]

as:

http://mydomain.com/dbimage/image/85/field_image_dogs/0/dog-playing-with-ball
